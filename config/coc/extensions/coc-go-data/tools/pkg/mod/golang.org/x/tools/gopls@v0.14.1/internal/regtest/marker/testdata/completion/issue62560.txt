This test verifies that completion of package members in unimported packages
reflects their fuzzy score, even when those members are present in the
transitive import graph of the main module. (For technical reasons, this was
the nature of the regression in golang/go#62560.)

-- go.mod --
module mod.test

-- foo/foo.go --
package foo

func _() {
	json.U //@rankl(re"U()", "Unmarshal", "InvalidUTF8Error"), diag("json", re"(undefined|undeclared)")
}

-- bar/bar.go --
package bar

import _ "encoding/json"
