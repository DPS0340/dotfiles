This test exercises diagnostics produced for type errors
in the absence of syntax errors.

The type error was chosen to exercise the 'nonewvars' type-error analyzer.
(The 'undeclaredname' analyzer depends on the text of the go/types
"undeclared name" error, which changed in go1.20.)

The append() type error was also carefully chosen to have text and
position that are invariant across all versions of Go run by the builders.

}
