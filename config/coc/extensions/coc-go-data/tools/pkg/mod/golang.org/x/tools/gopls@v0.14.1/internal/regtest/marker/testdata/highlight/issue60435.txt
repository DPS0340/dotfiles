This is a regression test for issue 60435:
Highlighting "net/http" shouldn't have any effect
on an import path that contains it as a substring,
such as httptest.

-- highlights.go --
package highlights

import (
	"net/http"          //@loc(httpImp, `"net/http"`)
	"net/http/httptest" //@loc(httptestImp, `"net/http/httptest"`)
)

var _ = httptest.NewRequest
var _ = http.NewRequest //@loc(here, "http"), highlight(here, here, httpImp)
