Vulnerability #1: GO-2021-0265
    A maliciously crafted path can cause Get and other query functions to
    consume excessive amounts of CPU and time.
  More info: https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2021-0265
  Module: github.com/tidwall/gjson
    Found in: github.com/tidwall/gjson@v1.6.5
    Fixed in: github.com/tidwall/gjson@v1.9.3
    Example traces found:
      #1: gjson.Get
      #2: gjson.Result.Get

Vulnerability #2: GO-2021-0113
    Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can
    cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process
    untrusted user inputs, this may be used as a vector for a denial of service
    attack.

Vulnerability #3: GO-2021-0054
    Due to improper bounds checking, maliciously crafted JSON objects can cause
